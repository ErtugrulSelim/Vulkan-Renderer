# Vulkan Renderer (Work in Progress)

> **⚠️ Disclaimer:** This is a learning project. I am currently in the early stages of exploring the **Vulkan API** and modern graphics programming. The renderer is under active development and is not yet a complete or feature-rich engine.

A performance-focused rendering engine being built from the ground up using **C++** and **Vulkan**. This repository serves as a portfolio of my learning journey in low-level graphics development.

## 🚀 Current Project Status
-  Setting up the Vulkan Instance and Validation Layers.
-  Window integration with GLFW.
-  Basic Physical & Logical Device selection.
-  Graphics Pipeline & Swapchain implementation (Upcoming).
-  Drawing the first triangle.

## 🛠️ Built With
* **Vulkan API:** Learning the core concepts of modern GPU communication.
* **C++:** Focused on writing clean and efficient systems code.
* **GLFW:** Used for window management and input handling.
* **GLM:** For essential mathematical operations.

## 🔧 Prerequisites & Setup

*Note: Since the project is in its early stages, the build system is currently configured for Visual Studio 2022 on Windows.*

1. **Vulkan SDK:** Install the latest version from [LunarG](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/).
2. **Libraries:** Ensure you have **GLFW** and **GLM** headers/libraries linked in your Visual Studio project properties.
3. **Build:** Open the `.sln` file, set the target to **x64**, and compile.
